# School Management System
Welcome to the School Management System project! This Java-based application is designed to provide a comprehensive solution for managing school-related tasks using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles and efficient data structures.

## Features
Graphical User Interface (GUI): The system boasts an intuitive and interactive GUI that simplifies navigation and enhances the overall user experience.

<b>Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Principles:</b>

* Encapsulation: The project encapsulates related operations within classes, promoting modular and maintainable code.
* Inheritance: Inheritance is utilized to establish a hierarchy of classes, promoting code reuse and extensibility.
* Polymorphism: The system leverages polymorphism to allow different classes to be treated uniformly, enhancing flexibility.
 
<b>Data Structures:</b>

The project employs various data structures for efficient data management and manipulation.
ArrayLists: Used for dynamic storage of student information, enabling easy addition, removal, and editing of student records.

<b>Student Management:</b>

* Add Students: Easily add new students to the system, providing essential information such as name, ID, and contact details.
* Remove Students: Efficiently remove students from the in-memory database while maintaining data integrity.
* Edit Students: Update student details with ease, ensuring accurate and up-to-date information.

<b>Persistence</b>:

The system includes basic data persistence, storing student information in-memory during runtime.

<b>Getting Started:</b>

To get started with the School Management System, follow these steps:
Clone the repository to your local machine.

Copy code
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/school-management-system.git
```
* Open the project in your favorite Java IDE.
* Compile and run the application.

<b>How to Use:</b>
* Launch the application to access the user-friendly GUI.
* Navigate through the intuitive menus to perform various student management operations.
* Enjoy the simplicity and efficiency of the School Management System!

<b>Note:</b>
The current version of the system includes basic in-memory data persistence. However, any changes made to student records will not persist after the application is closed.
